# Echoes of Korea: i18n Revised Implementation Plan

**Document Status:** Finalized & Approved
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-18

## 1. Objective

Integrate internationalization (i18n) into the "Echoes of Korea" application to support both Korean (`ko`) and English (`en`). This plan outlines a phased approach to apply i18n to the admin panel and future public-facing site, ensuring a seamless user experience and robust technical foundation.

## 2. Core Strategy & Technology

*   **Library:** **`next-intl`** will be used for its excellent compatibility with the Next.js App Router.
*   **Routing:** A **path-based routing** strategy (e.g., `/en/admin`, `/ko/admin`) will be implemented for clarity and SEO benefits.
*   **Translation Files:** UI strings will be managed in **JSON files** (`messages/en.json`, `messages/ko.json`).
*   **Type Safety:** Translation keys will be **strongly-typed** to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.

## 3. Phased Implementation Plan

This project will be implemented in phases to ensure stability and manage complexity.

### Phase 1: Foundational i18n Setup (High Priority)

**Goal:** Integrate `next-intl` with the existing Supabase authentication middleware and set up the basic i18n framework.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Library:**
    ```bash
    npm install next-intl
    ```

2.  **Create Translation Files:**
    *   Create `messages/en.json` and `messages/ko.json` with initial UI strings.
    *   Define a type for translation keys based on the message files for type safety, as suggested.
      ```typescript
      // types/i18n.ts
      type Messages = typeof import('../messages/ko.json');
      // Define more granular types as needed
      ```

3.  **Configure `next-intl`:**
    *   Create `i18n.ts` to define supported locales (`en`, `ko`) and load message files dynamically.

4.  **Combine Middlewares (Critical Task):**
    *   Update `middleware.ts` to compose the `next-intl` middleware and the Supabase authentication middleware. The `next-intl` middleware should run first to establish the locale.
    *   **Implementation Note:** The auth logic must be adapted to handle locale-aware redirects (e.g., redirecting to `/[locale]/login`).

    ```typescript
    // middleware.ts (Conceptual)
    import createIntlMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
    import { updateSession } from '@/utils/supabase/middleware'; // Supabase middleware logic
    import { locales } from './i18n';

    const intlMiddleware = createIntlMiddleware({
      locales,
      defaultLocale: 'ko'
    });

    export async function middleware(request) {
      // 1. First, handle i18n to determine the locale
      const i18nResponse = intlMiddleware(request);
      
      // 2. Then, pass the response to the auth middleware
      return await updateSession(i18nResponse);
    }
    ```

5.  **Update Directory Structure:**
    *   Rename `app` subdirectories to be under `app/[locale]/` to enable path-based routing.

6.  **Update Root Layout:**
    *   Modify `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` to include the `NextIntlClientProvider`.

7.  **Implement Language Switcher:**
    *   Create a client component (`LanguageSwitcher.tsx`) that allows users to change the locale.

### Phase 2: Database and UI Integration (Medium Priority)

**Goal:** Adapt the database schema for multilingual content and update the admin UI to manage it.

**Steps:**

1.  **Database Migration (Phased Approach):**
    *   **Step 2.1:** Add new `JSONB` columns (`title_i18n`, `llm_summary_i18n`) to the `interviews` table without deleting the old ones.
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE interviews ADD COLUMN title_i18n JSONB, ADD COLUMN llm_summary_i18n JSONB;
      ```
    *   **Step 2.2:** Run a one-time script to migrate existing data from the old `TEXT` columns to the new `JSONB` columns, setting the default locale (`ko`).
      ```sql
      UPDATE interviews SET title_i18n = jsonb_build_object('ko', title) WHERE title_i18n IS NULL;
      ```

2.  **Create Content Helper Functions:**
    *   Implement `getLocalizedContent` and `setLocalizedContent` helper functions in `lib/i18n-helpers.ts` to provide a consistent way of accessing and mutating `JSONB` data based on the current locale.

3.  **Update Admin UI:**
    *   Modify the interview creation/editing forms in the admin panel.
    *   For fields like `title`, display input tabs or separate fields for Korean and English.
    *   Use the helper functions to read from and write to the new `_i18n` database columns.

4.  **Cleanup (Post-Verification):**
    *   After verifying that the new system is stable and all data has been migrated, schedule the removal of the old `title` and `llm_summary` columns.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & User Experience (Low Priority)

**Goal:** Enhance the user experience and prepare for future growth.

**Steps:**

1.  **Enhanced URL Strategy:**
    *   Implement logic in the middleware to detect the user's browser language preference on their first visit and redirect to the appropriate locale (e.g., `/` -> `/ko`).
    *   Store the user's language preference in a cookie for subsequent visits.

2.  **Admin Content Management:**
    *   Enhance the admin UI to include translation status indicators (e.g., "English translation needed").

3.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   As the project grows, monitor bundle sizes. If translation files become very large, consider lazy-loading them.

## 4. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Write tests for the combined middleware, helper functions, and UI components.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Verify the complete user flow: language switching, locale-aware redirects, and CRUD operations on multilingual data.
*   **Manual Testing:** Confirm that all UI elements render correctly in both English and Korean.
